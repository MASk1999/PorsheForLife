    <p class="paragraph"> Porsche taycan is the brand new product from porsche. The taycan is ready for the future, thanks to its innovative total concept. It is characterised by the features that have always been decisive for any porche: Pure emotion and maximum driving pleasure.The name "Taycan" roughly translates from Turkish as "lively young horse" in reference to the steed of the Stuttgart coat of arms on the Porsche crest.The interior of the car is based around up to four digital displays, including a curved, free-standing 16.8 inch configurable driver's display. This marks Porsche's first fully digital instrument binnacle. A 10.9 inch screen is situated to the right of the instrument binnacle which serves as the infotainment system of the car. An optional screen is placed to the right of the infotainment screen which allows the front passenger to customise the infotainment system. An 8.4 inch screen is present in a portrait layout on the centre console with a trackpad to control the functions. The screen displays the status of the powertrain and tells the driver to efficiently use the power. Despite using an all digital layout, the dashboard features the classic Porsche clock on the top.
